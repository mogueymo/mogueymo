## Interesting Dataset
The dataset that I found interesting was [this dataset from Reddit trying to capture the full scope of the COVID-19 pandemic](https://socialgrep.com/datasets/the-reddit-covid-dataset). It collected everything posted about COVID-19 into one spot.
I found it interesting because it was the only COVID-19 dataset I've seen that really captured the human element beyond just numbers and statistics.
